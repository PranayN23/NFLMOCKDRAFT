# NFLMOCKDRAFT
An NFL MOCK DRAFT SIMULATOR
Welcome to the NFL Mock Draft Simulator for the 2022 season! This Java-based project is designed to provide a user-friendly experience, featuring efficient data management, complex draft logic, a real NFL statistics-driven trading system, and robust error handling using regular expressions.

## Key Features

**Data Structures:** We utilize a range of Data Structures, such as HashMaps, Tree Maps, and ArrayLists, to efficiently manage and manipulate data throughout the simulation.

**Data Collection and Manipulation:** The project excels in collecting and processing data via File Processing, enabling seamless integration of real NFL statistics and player data.

**Complex Draft Logic:** Our simulator incorporates sophisticated draft logic, taking into account various factors like player rankings, team needs, and trade possibilities to simulate a realistic NFL draft experience.

**Real NFL Statistics-Driven Trading System:** Users can engage in trades based on real NFL statistics, allowing for dynamic team-building strategies and realistic trade scenarios.

**Robust Error Handling:** We've implemented a robust error handling system using regular expressions to ensure that the simulator gracefully handles unexpected input and errors, providing a smooth user experience.
